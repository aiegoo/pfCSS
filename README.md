# pfCSS
advanced css only CSS portfolio. can you pull it off!! why'd u try sass too!
Advanced CSS means that I am going to stick with CSS3 and not quite commonly used functions, such as perspective and keyframes that will turn every html tag elements into a dynamic page.
I hope to turn my work to SASS in the process and commit to its methods including webpack.

I will not have a design or wireframe as this wouldn't require that much, but I had a sketch of functionality I want to accomplish.


tools to be used with;
mixin, postcss?, iconfont, bennettfeely, browsersync (plz add and update your choice)
